# Description

This is a simpler CSS library (thanks to Tailwind CSS fro inspiration) that I'm creating to learn some HTML and css.  
It has CSS classes that can be used to style HTML easily.

# DOCS

1. "**styles/div.css**":  
    - Just by linking it in the HTML file (```<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/div.css">```) you get the default functionality. (DOCS Upcoming)
    - Then you can add a div element with the classes that style it however you want (```<div class="canter fit bordered..."></div>```).

2. "**styles/img.css**":
    - For now, pretty much same as the div.
